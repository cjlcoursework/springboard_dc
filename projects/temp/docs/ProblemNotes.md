Big Mountain Resort  

## Context

- Operating costs up - New Lift costs having an impact
- Approach to pricing has been to increase price (premium pricing == Above Avergae for similar segments?)

- Is Big Mountain capitalizing on its facilities?

- Basing their pricing on just the market average does not provide the business with a
good sense of how important some facilities are compared to others

- Investment Strategy is ...hampered?   -- this says they don't know how much and where to invest - and maybe how they can capitalize on investment
  - Yeah - but does this mean they want to know how much to invest
  - Kinda goes to how much can I recapture of any investment
  - 
- What makes one facility more valuable - 'worth' more than another?
- 
- Stated question:  how to select better pricing?  What to base it on?  What makes a facility suppport higher pricing?

- Also, looking at:
  - cutting costs
  - changes to alloe higher pricing


  - Current Strategy
  - Charge a premium above average market price
